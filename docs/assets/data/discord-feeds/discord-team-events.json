    "content": "@everyone\n\n🌿 Safari Siege (6/17/25) 🌿\nThe wild calls, and we answer. We are Shiny Legion — many, relentless, united in purpose.\nWithin the shadows of the Safari, rare prey lurk, but they cannot hide from the Legion’s gaze.\nThe Siege begins. One by one, the targets will fall.\n<strong>We are many. We are Legion. And the Safari will remember us.</strong>\n\n🎯 How to Play:\n🔹 Enter the Safari Zone when the Siege begins.\n🔹 Hunt and catch the Pokémon that match the targets on the BINGO board.\n🔹 Each time you catch a target, whisper it to the host(s) in a link. They will mark your squares.\n🔹 The first hunter to complete a BINGO (5 in a row — horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) claims victory.\n\n⚔️ Rules:\n✅ Only catches made during the event period count.\n✅ All catches must come from the announced Safari Zone location.\n✅ You must provide proof for each entry in a whisper to the host(s).\n✅ OT only — you must be the original trainer of your catches.\n✅ Pokémon must remain unchanged (no evolving, breeding, or modifying).\n✅ Only one character per participant may join the Siege.\n\n🏆 Prizes:\n👑 1st Place: 5×31 Jolly Alpha Shroomish (EV Trained and level 1 | Donated by <a href=\"https://discord.com/users/591451083801362463\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"discord-user-mention\">@Ricxn</a> ) — a true prize for the swiftest of the Many.\n⚡ 2nd Place: 3×31 Jolly Shroomish (EV Trained and level 1) — earned by the hunter who follows close behind.\n\nThe BINGO board will be posted at the start of the event. All players participating will meet at Kanto Safari Zone Ch. 2 at 5PM EST.",
